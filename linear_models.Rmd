```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) %>% 
  rename(
    boro = neighbourhood_group,
    neighborhood = neighbourhood) %>% 
  filter(boro != "Staten Island") %>% 
  select(price, stars, boro, neighborhood, room_type)
```

Fit a linear model

```{r}
fit <- lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
fit

summary(fit)
coef(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
```

## Tidy the results
```{r}
fit %>% 
    broom::tidy() %>% 
    mutate(term = str_replace(term, "boro", "Boro: ")) %>% 
    knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```


## Take a look at factors
```{r}
nyc_airbnb <- 
    nyc_airbnb %>% 
    mutate(
        boro = fct_infreq(boro), # fct_infreq will reorder factors according to frequency
        room_type = fct_infreq(room_type))
```

## Refit the last model
```{r}
fit <- lm(price ~ stars + boro, data = nyc_airbnb)

fit %>% 
    broom::tidy() # more useful function of broom

fit %>%
    broom::glance() # good to know that this broom function exists
```
